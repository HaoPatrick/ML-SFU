- labName: "Autonomy Lab"
  picPath: "autonomy.jpg"
  description: "The Autonomy Lab's research goal is to increase the capabilities, robustness and overall autonomy of mobile robot systems. Our research has these main themes:
    applying the latest AI-based sensing techniques to robot navigation and human-robot interaction
    creating tools and techniques for programming, simulating and evaluating populations of robots
    applying models of animal behavior to extend or improve robots, particularly multi-robot systems."

- labName: "Natural Language Lab"
  picPath: "natlang.jpg"
  description: "
   Our lab has a particular focus on research into statistical machine translation and the visual and textual summarization of information contained in natural language. We are always looking for motivated, good graduate students. We are also keen on fostering links with industry for joint projects that are based on research grants and/or student internships that allow graduate students to spend time at companies doing high-risk high-reward natural language processing projects."

- labName: "Vision and Media Lab"
  picPath: "vml.jpg"
  description: "We develop algorithms for interpreting and processing visual data â€” images and videos. These algorithms facilitate a range of applications from enabling video search to enhancing the visual quality of photographs. We focus on image and video analysis, object recognition, human activity recognition, and machine learning."

- labName: "Computational Logic Lab"
  picPath: "datamining.jpg"
  description: "Interests of the members of the group include, among other areas, logics for knowledge representation and for representing and reasoning about dynamic systems, belief revision, theorem proving, constraint satisfaction, database theory, and complexity of related computational tasks."

- labName: "Database and Data Mining Lab"
  picPath: "datamining.jpg"
  description: "Our lab also investigates emerging applications of information systems posing new database systems challenges such as on-demand map generation and focused web crawlers. The challenges of on-demand map generation, for example, are the complexity of map generalization operations and the ill-defined notion of the quality of the resulting maps. "
