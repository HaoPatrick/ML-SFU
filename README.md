### Update instructions

Just edit files in `contents/` and then commit the change, it will deploy automatically. 

For example, I want to add an image to the carousel of the home page:

- open `contents/carousel.json` and append an new item similar to the previous one

- copy the image to the `contents/img`

- commit the change
